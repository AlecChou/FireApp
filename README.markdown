We have decided to discontinue the Compass.app & Fire.app projects. You can still get the source code under GPL as always, and we have put the latest binary on GitHub for free. [What happened?](https://github.com/KKBOX/compassapp/wiki/farewell)

# Fire.app

[Fire.app][fireapp] is a **menubar only app** for dead easy HTML prototyping.

Fire.app is written in **Java (JRuby)**, and works in mac, linux and pc.

## System Requirement

Fire.app has been tested in:

* Windows: Windows 7/Vista/XP
* OS X: 10.5, 10.6 32/64bit, 10.7 32/64bit
* Linux: Arch Linux 32/64bit

Fire.app is written in **Java (JRuby)**, so you must install JRE(Java Runtime Environment) first. If you do not have JRE installed, Fire.app will guide you to install it first.

## Download

You can download [the latest release](https://github.com/KKBOX/FireApp/releases).

## Install

There is no need to **install** Fire.app. You can just unzip and put it anywhere. You can even use Dropbox to sync between computers.

## Build Your Own

If you want to build your own copy, you will need Java 7, [JRuby](http://jruby.org/) and [rawr](http://rawr.rubyforge.org/).
